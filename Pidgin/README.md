# Dark theme
* Goto http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/Main/Downloads
* Install gtk2-themes-*.exe
* If Pidgin was installed in the currently standard way, GTK will be installed within it. Thus, direct the Installation to that "Pidgin\GTK" folder.
* After Installation, move "gtk2_prefs.exe" from "Pidgin\GTK" to "Pidgin\GTK\bin" subfolder. This is the preference tool (theme selector) file that the installer puts in the wrong place. If this isn't done, the preference tool will not see the new themes loaded.
* Go to "Pidgin\GTK\bin"
* Start "gtk2_prefs.exe"
* Pick theme: **Nodoka-Midnight**
